# version-control

## Overview

### The objective of this lab is to understand the purpose and usefulness of version control. Your will work as a group of two. You will write a simplified password encoder/decoder program and practice the functions of version control systems to develop familiarity with them. 

## Encoder
### The password encoder should take in an 8-digit password in string format containing only integers. 
### After passing the password into the encoder, the encoder stores the encoded password to a new variable, with each digit being shifted up by 3 numbers. 

#### Examples: 
#### “12345555” will become “45678888” after encoding. 
#### “00009962” will become “33332295” after encoding. 

## Decoder
#### The password decoder takes in the encoded password and returns the original password. “45678888” needs to be decoded back to “12345555” after decoding.
